# Analyze-Air-Pollution-in-Seattle
In recent years there has been much attention paid to possible health risks from very small particles in the air. These particles are collectively referred to as `particulate matter air pollution' (PM). In the northeast US, the concentrations of PM are highest in the summer when they include diesel and gasoline exhaust and particles produced by large power stations in the industrial midwest. Many studies have found that both cardiovascular and pulmonary morbidity and mortality are very slightly higher on days when PM concentrations are high.

In Seattle, there is relatively little diesel and almost no coal smoke.
Concentrations of PM are highest on cold clear winter nights, partly because of large amounts of wood smoke and partly because the air is stagnant and the pollution is trapped near the surface.

Because of the differences in seasonal pattern and composition of Seattle particulate air pollution, there is interest in ascertaining whether the associations with morbidity and mortality are still found here. We have data on hospital admissions for respiratory disease in King County hospitals, and as a control, hospital admissions for gastrointestinal disease, which is not thought to be affected by air pollution.

The reason for choosing Seattle Air Pollution Dataset is that it offers a valuable opportunity to explore the associations between PM air pollution and health outcomes in a setting with distinct sources and seasonal patterns of particulate matter. By examining the effects in this specific context, researchers can gain insights that may complement and expand the existing knowledge about air pollution's health impacts and provide valuable information for public health and environmental policy decision-making.
